Title: JavaScript-Aptitude-Test

Rudimentary JavaScript Online Quiz

Technologies: HTML, JavaScript

Introduction: The goal of this JavaScript online quiz was to create an introductory quiz using JavsScript.

Scope of Functionality: When the page is loaded, the user is promted to take a quiz. The quiz begins when the user clicks the start button. The user then has 60 seconds to take a 5 question quiz. If a question is answered correctly, 1 point is added to their score. If they answer incorrectly, 5 seconds is taken off of the timer, and no points are awarded. Once the game is over, the user is informed of their score and the completion of the game.

Scope of JavaScript: Classes and IDs were created in the HTML. We then captured their reference and stored them in variables. This allowed us to work within the DOM model in the .js page. AddEventListeneres and functions were used to create proper workflow while executing. Callback functions were used in conjuction with the AddEventListeners. Data points were also assigned to buttons in order to give them a value.

Problems Faced: The main challenge on this project was getting everything properly migrated over to the .js page via capturing references. Once these variables were created in the .js files, creating a workflow process using the AddEventListeners and functions was the next challenge. Order of operations had to be minded.

Potential Future Plans: Adding some color and .css properties to the page. Being able to pring your results.
